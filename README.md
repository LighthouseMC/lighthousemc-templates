Each template must be in its own directory, which contains a `template.toml` and `build.sh` file.

For a starting point, see the `blank` template.

The `template.toml` file follows this format:
```toml
[template]
name        = "Name of the template"
description = "A short description of the template. This could be the slogan of the language being supported."
icon        = "Base64 Minecraft skin texture value" # You can generate one using https://mineskin.org.
homepage    = "https://example.com" # OPTIONAL: A link to the homepage of the language being supported.
advanced    = true # OPTIONAL: This indicates that this is a template may take more work to set up.

exclude = [ # OPTIONAL: A list of files or directories to exclude from the template.
    "file_or_dir_name",
    "icon.png"
]
```
